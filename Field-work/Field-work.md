# Field Work
This section details the protocol and resources for the various types of field work conducted by the Healthy Headwaters Lab.

## General
### Safety
**ALWAYS make sure someone *not in the field* knows where you are and when you will be back. NEVER do field work alone!**    
Health and safety in the field are paramount. Research is **never** worth risking injury. If you are ever in a situation in the field where you feel unsafe, immediately discontinue the fieldwork. You can contact Catherine or the project manager to discuss options for delaying or modifying the field work, depending on the situation.  
  
  *All accidents, injuries and near misses (no injury) must be reported to a supervisor as soon as they occur.*  
  
For more information on accident reporting, see the University of Windsor [Health and Safety protocol](http://www1.uwindsor.ca/safety/report-an-accident)
  
Everyone involved in field work should be adequately trained. It is ok to not know something - and if you forget, just ask! It is always better to double check with others if you're unsure about protocols, rather than risk your safety or compromise data.

### Resources 
#### Lab Activities Inventory 
The Healthy Headwaters Activities Inventory (Shared HHL Dropbox/1.Healthy Headwaters Lab Activities INVENTORY.xlsx) tracks all types of activities the Healthy Headwaters Lab is conducting, across all projects. The activities inventory in managed by the research facilitator but can be added to by anyone. Activities from field activity plans will automatically be added to the inventory, but please let Jess I. know if you are participating in other activities (e.g., partner meetings, public outreach) and it will also be added.

#### Field work checklist 
A current field work checklist can be found in Dropbox (Shared HHL Dropbox/Forms/Field-gear-checklist.docx)

### Transportation
The Healthy Headwaters Lab has a lab vehicle named CJ (for the license plate!). Due to GLIER policies, only staff members are allowed to drive CJ. More info on using CJ [here](/Equipment/CJ.md)   
  
When using CJ for meetings/field work/etc., please sign her out on the lab Google Calendar.

### Before Leaving GLIER
* Fill out a Field Activity Plan (Shared HHL Dropbox/Forms/Field-Activity-Plan.docx) and send it to Catherine and Jess Ives.  The Field Activity Plan will be saved on Dropbox and serve as a partial record of our lab activities.
* Make sure you have all of the supplies and equipment you need (Complete the [field work checklist])
* Sign any equipment out on the [Asana Equipment Locations Sheet](https://app.asana.com/0/1128801752832452/board)

### When You Return
* Check in with Catherine and anyone else who knew you were in the field
* Make sure you clean all of the items you brought into the field, put them back where they belong, and replenish any supplies you used from the field kit. 
* Sign back in any equipment you signed out on Asana.  
* If anything broke or acted funny in the field, let Alyssa know, so it can be fixed.
* If you came up with any new protocols or ideas about how to improve field work - bring them up to Catherine, and if appropriate, add them as a suggested change to the Wiki!
